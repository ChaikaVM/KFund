    <h1>Superhero trivia</h1>
    <h2 id="h2_1">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.</p>
    <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

    <p>Out of time hero Steve Rogers fights for freedom as the unwavering Captain America.During World War II, a young Stephen Rogers agreed to participate in a top – secret pilot program to create super soldiers, which turned him into the invincible Captain America-a living symbol of freedom. After spending many years frozen in the ice, the legendary hero woke up again to continue the battle for justice.
        Stephen Rogers had a frail physique and poor health since childhood, so his persistent attempts to get into the army at the beginning of the war were not crowned with success. However, they did not go unnoticed, and Rogers became a member of the secret operation "Rebirth" - a project to create super-soldiers using a serum that brings a person's physical abilities to a peak.
